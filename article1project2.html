        Create an article that gives some tips and tricks to new python programmers to implement pylint. Create a glossary of OOP terms with definitions: Factory, instantiation, object, class, namespace, constructor, fixture, type hint, type cast, unit test, static, class method, facade, design patterns used, method, property and any other terms you found important What is object oriented programming
        Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring
        programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
        For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and
        behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with
        properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.
        Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program
        like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow
        sequentially in order to complete a task.
        The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only
        representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as
        well.
        <ul>1)Factory
        In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects
        – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype
            or class from some method call</ul>
        <ul>2)instantiation
        Instantiating a class is creating a copy of the class which inherits all class variables and
        methods. Instantiating a class in Python is simple. To instantiate a class, we simply call
        the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method
            defines.</ul>
        <ul>3)object,
        An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a
        copy of the class with actual values. Python is object oriented programming language
            which stress on objects i.e. it mainly emphasize on functions.</ul>
        <ul>4)class,
        “Class” is a logical grouping of functions and data. Python class provides all the
        standard features of Object Oriented Programming. ... In Python, a class can inherit
            attributes and behavior methods from another class called subclass or heir class</ul>
        <ul>5)namespace,
        Namespaces in Python. A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic
        names along with information about the object that each name references. You can
        think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the
            values are the objects themselves.</ul>
        <ul>6) constructor,
        What is constructor in OOP Python?
        Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is
        to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class
        is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called
        when an object is created</ul>
        <ul>7) fixture,
        Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test (see
        Anatomy of a test). In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They
        can also be used to define a test's act phase; this is a powerful technique for designing
            more complex tests.</ul>
        <ul>8)type hint, Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your
        Python code. It was specified in PEP 484 and introduced in Python 3.5. Here's an
            example of adding type information to a function</ul>
        <ul>9)type cast, Type casting is a method used to change the variables/ values declared in a certain
        data type into a different data type to match the operation required to be performed by
        the code snippet. In python, this feature can be accomplished by using constructor
            functions like int(), string(), float(), etc</ul>
        <ul>10)unit test,
        The unit test framework in Python is called unittest , which comes packaged with
        Python. Unit testing makes your code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code could potentially fail or produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all of the
            cases, you still address most of them</ul>
        <ul>11) static,
        The static variable and static method are the widely used programming concepts in
        various languages such as C++, PHP, Java, etc. These variables and methods belong to
        the class and the objects. In this section, we will learn how we create static variables
            and methods in Python.</ul> <ul>12)class method,
        A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
        They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points
        to the class and not the object instance. It can modify a class state that would apply
    across all the instances of the class</ul>
        <ul>13)facade, Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to
        a complex system of classes, library or framework. While Facade decreases the overall
        complexity of the application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies to one
            place.</ul>
    <ul>14)design patterns used, Design Patterns is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers</ul>
        <ul>15)method
        A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not
        unique to class instances: other object types can have methods as well. For example,
            list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on.</ul>
